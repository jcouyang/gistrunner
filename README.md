# Gist Runner

like AWS Lambda, but much lighter, and only for Ruby!

## Get started
write some ruby code in gist.github.com

e.g.
```
https://gist.github.com/jcouyang/edc3d175769e893b39e6c5be12a8526f
                       |
       add an .ru here |
                       v
https://gist.github.com.ru/jcouyang/edc3d175769e893b39e6c5be12a8526f
```

then you will got an API

## Global Variables

### `req`
### `params`
### `body`
